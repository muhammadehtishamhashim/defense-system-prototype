# Requirements Document

## Introduction

HifazatAI is a comprehensive security AI system prototype designed to demonstrate feasibility across three critical security domains: threat intelligence analysis, video surveillance analytics, and border anomaly detection. The system will integrate multiple AI pipelines to produce actionable alerts through a unified dashboard, targeting defense and security applications with a focus on precision and real-time detection capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Threat Intelligence Processing

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want an automated threat intelligence system that processes multiple data feeds and identifies high-risk indicators, so that I can quickly respond to emerging threats without manually parsing large volumes of data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system receives threat intelligence feeds THEN it SHALL parse and extract Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) including IPs, domains, file hashes, and CVEs with 80% or higher precision
2. WHEN an IOC is extracted THEN the system SHALL classify it as High, Medium, or Low risk using machine learning models
3. WHEN a high-risk indicator is identified THEN the system SHALL generate a structured alert in JSON format containing timestamp, type, value, risk score, and source
4. IF multiple feeds contain the same indicator THEN the system SHALL aggregate the information and update the risk score accordingly
5. WHEN processing threat feeds THEN the system SHALL complete analysis within 30 seconds of feed ingestion

### Requirement 2: Video Surveillance Analytics

**User Story:** As a security operator, I want automated video analysis that detects and tracks people, vehicles, and suspicious behaviors in real-time, so that I can monitor multiple camera feeds efficiently and respond to security incidents promptly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing video input THEN the system SHALL detect and classify objects (people, vehicles, luggage) with 85% or higher accuracy
2. WHEN objects are detected THEN the system SHALL assign unique tracking IDs and maintain tracking across video frames
3. WHEN a person remains in the same area for more than a configurable threshold THEN the system SHALL generate a loitering alert
4. WHEN an object enters a predefined restricted zone THEN the system SHALL trigger a zone violation alert
5. WHEN a static object is left unattended for more than a configurable time THEN the system SHALL generate an abandoned object alert
6. WHEN generating alerts THEN the system SHALL include bounding boxes, tracking information, snapshot images, and timestamps
7. WHEN processing video THEN the system SHALL maintain real-time performance with less than 2-second latency

### Requirement 3: Border Anomaly Detection

**User Story:** As a border security officer, I want an AI system that automatically detects unusual movement patterns and behaviors in border surveillance footage, so that I can identify potential security threats and unauthorized crossings without continuous manual monitoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing border camera feeds THEN the system SHALL extract and analyze movement trajectories of detected objects
2. WHEN trajectory features are computed THEN the system SHALL calculate speed, path curvature, entry angle, and duration metrics
3. WHEN running anomaly detection THEN the system SHALL identify unusual patterns using unsupervised learning with configurable sensitivity
4. WHEN an anomaly is detected THEN the system SHALL generate alerts with severity scores and supporting video frames
5. WHEN processing border footage THEN the system SHALL achieve anomaly recall of 70% or higher on test datasets
6. IF no object tracking is available THEN the system SHALL use motion-based anomaly detection as a fallback

### Requirement 4: Unified Alert Management

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want a centralized system that collects, stores, and manages alerts from all AI pipelines, so that I can maintain a comprehensive security posture and ensure no critical alerts are missed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any pipeline generates an alert THEN the system SHALL receive and store it in a structured database
2. WHEN storing alerts THEN the system SHALL include metadata such as source pipeline, confidence score, and processing timestamp
3. WHEN alerts are received THEN the system SHALL provide REST API endpoints for alert retrieval and management
4. WHEN multiple alerts are generated THEN the system SHALL support filtering, sorting, and pagination
5. WHEN alert data is stored THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity and support backup/recovery operations

### Requirement 5: Dashboard and Visualization

**User Story:** As a security operator, I want an intuitive dashboard that displays real-time alerts, video feeds, and system status, so that I can quickly assess the security situation and take appropriate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display a live feed of incoming alerts with timestamps
2. WHEN viewing alerts THEN the system SHALL show alert details including source, type, confidence, and supporting evidence
3. WHEN video alerts are displayed THEN the system SHALL include snapshot images and bounding box visualizations
4. WHEN reviewing alerts THEN the system SHALL support playback and drill-down functionality for detailed analysis
5. WHEN displaying system status THEN the dashboard SHALL show pipeline health, processing metrics, and performance indicators
6. WHEN alerts require attention THEN the system SHALL provide visual indicators and notification mechanisms

### Requirement 6: System Performance and Reliability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the HifazatAI system to operate reliably under normal load conditions with predictable performance characteristics, so that security operations can depend on consistent threat detection capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing normal workloads THEN the system SHALL maintain 99% uptime during operational hours
2. WHEN handling concurrent requests THEN the system SHALL support at least 10 simultaneous video streams
3. WHEN storing alert data THEN the system SHALL maintain data persistence and prevent data loss
4. WHEN system errors occur THEN the system SHALL log errors appropriately and attempt graceful recovery
5. WHEN resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL degrade gracefully while maintaining core functionality

### Requirement 7: Data Privacy and Security

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want the system to handle sensitive security data according to privacy regulations and security best practices, so that we maintain legal compliance and protect sensitive information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing video data THEN the system SHALL avoid persistent storage of personally identifiable information
2. WHEN storing alerts THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate data retention policies
3. WHEN handling sensitive data THEN the system SHALL provide audit logging for data access and modifications
4. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL support face redaction and privacy protection features
5. WHEN accessing the system THEN users SHALL be authenticated and authorized appropriately

### Requirement 8: Evaluation and Testing

**User Story:** As a project evaluator, I want comprehensive testing and evaluation capabilities that demonstrate system performance against defined metrics, so that I can assess the prototype's readiness for further development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running evaluation scripts THEN the system SHALL produce precision, recall, and accuracy metrics for each pipeline
2. WHEN testing threat intelligence THEN the system SHALL achieve 80% or higher precision for high-risk classifications
3. WHEN testing video analytics THEN the system SHALL achieve 85% or higher detection accuracy
4. WHEN testing anomaly detection THEN the system SHALL achieve 70% or higher recall on labeled test data
5. WHEN generating evaluation reports THEN the system SHALL include confusion matrices, sample outputs, and performance analysis
