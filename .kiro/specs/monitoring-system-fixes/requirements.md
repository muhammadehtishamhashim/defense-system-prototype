# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The HifazatAI monitoring system currently suffers from several critical issues that impact user experience and system performance. The pipeline status component is not displaying real data, performance metrics are either not showing or flickering due to data regeneration, and the backend is generating excessive unnecessary HTTP requests. This feature addresses these core monitoring system problems to provide a stable, efficient, and reliable monitoring experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want to see accurate real-time pipeline status information, so that I can monitor the health and performance of all AI processing pipelines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the pipeline status component SHALL display actual pipeline data from the backend API
2. WHEN pipeline data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display appropriate fallback states with clear error messages
3. WHEN pipeline status changes THEN the component SHALL update within 30 seconds without requiring manual refresh
4. IF a pipeline goes offline THEN the system SHALL display the correct offline status with timestamp
5. WHEN multiple pipelines are running THEN each pipeline SHALL show independent status, metrics, and health indicators

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want stable performance metrics that don't flicker or disappear, so that I can reliably monitor system performance trends.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performance metrics load THEN the data SHALL remain stable and not regenerate randomly
2. WHEN switching between time ranges THEN the metrics SHALL update smoothly without flickering
3. WHEN the component re-renders THEN existing metric data SHALL persist and not be recalculated unnecessarily
4. IF metric data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL show loading states or cached data instead of empty components
5. WHEN real-time updates occur THEN new data SHALL be appended to existing datasets without full regeneration

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to minimize unnecessary backend requests, so that the system operates efficiently and reduces server load.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend requests system metrics THEN it SHALL use intelligent caching to avoid duplicate requests
2. WHEN multiple components need the same data THEN the system SHALL make only one API request and share the result
3. WHEN data is still fresh in cache THEN the system SHALL NOT make new API requests
4. IF a request fails THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff instead of immediate retry
5. WHEN the user is inactive THEN the system SHALL reduce polling frequency to conserve resources

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want consistent data flow between frontend and backend, so that I can trust the accuracy of displayed information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend provides system metrics THEN the frontend SHALL correctly parse and display all data fields
2. WHEN pipeline data structure changes THEN the frontend SHALL handle the changes gracefully without breaking
3. WHEN API responses are delayed THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states
4. IF API responses contain errors THEN the system SHALL display meaningful error messages to users
5. WHEN data is successfully loaded THEN all monitoring components SHALL reflect the same consistent state

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want real-time updates that work reliably, so that I can respond quickly to system changes and alerts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using Server-Sent Events THEN the connection SHALL remain stable and automatically reconnect if dropped
2. WHEN SSE data arrives THEN it SHALL be processed and displayed without causing component re-renders
3. WHEN the SSE connection fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to polling with appropriate intervals
4. IF real-time updates are disabled THEN the system SHALL still provide manual refresh capabilities
5. WHEN receiving heartbeat messages THEN the system SHALL NOT trigger unnecessary UI updates
