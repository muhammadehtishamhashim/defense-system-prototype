# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements real-time video streaming from backend to frontend with concurrent AI analysis and mock alert generation. The system will serve video files from the backend media folder to the frontend with looped, muted playback while simultaneously analyzing the video content in real-time to simulate live CCTV footage processing. Mock alerts will be generated every 30 seconds and sent to the frontend alerts page to demonstrate the complete monitoring workflow.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want to view live video streams in the frontend interface, so that I can monitor security footage in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the video analysis page THEN the system SHALL display the video with autoplay, loop, and muted attributes
2. WHEN the video is served from backend THEN the system SHALL stream the video file from backend/media/videos directory
3. WHEN the video loads THEN the system SHALL automatically start playback without user interaction
4. IF the video reaches the end THEN the system SHALL automatically restart from the beginning
5. WHEN the video plays THEN the system SHALL have audio muted by default

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security system, I want to analyze video content in real-time, so that I can detect security threats and anomalies as they occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a video is being streamed THEN the system SHALL simultaneously process the video frames for AI analysis
2. WHEN video analysis is running THEN the system SHALL use the existing video surveillance pipeline for object detection
3. WHEN processing video frames THEN the system SHALL maintain real-time performance without blocking video playback
4. IF the system detects objects or behaviors THEN the system SHALL log the detection results
5. WHEN analysis is active THEN the system SHALL provide status indicators showing the analysis is running

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want to receive automated alerts during video monitoring, so that I can respond to potential security incidents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the video analysis system is running THEN the system SHALL generate mock alerts every 30 seconds
2. WHEN an alert is generated THEN the system SHALL send the alert data to the frontend alerts page
3. WHEN alerts are created THEN the system SHALL include realistic security event data (threat type, confidence, timestamp, location)
4. WHEN alerts are sent THEN the system SHALL use the existing real-time alert feed mechanism
5. IF the alerts page is open THEN the system SHALL display new alerts immediately without page refresh

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the video streaming to work efficiently, so that the system can handle real-time processing without performance degradation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN serving video files THEN the system SHALL use efficient streaming protocols to minimize bandwidth usage
2. WHEN multiple components access video data THEN the system SHALL avoid duplicate file reads or processing
3. WHEN the system is under load THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive video playback and alert generation
4. IF system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL prioritize video streaming over analysis processing
5. WHEN video analysis is running THEN the system SHALL monitor and report performance metrics

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the video streaming implementation to be extensible, so that it can be adapted for live CCTV feeds in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing video streaming THEN the system SHALL use a modular architecture that can support multiple video sources
2. WHEN designing the video analysis pipeline THEN the system SHALL separate video input handling from processing logic
3. WHEN creating API endpoints THEN the system SHALL design them to support both file-based and live stream inputs
4. IF extending to live feeds THEN the system SHALL require minimal changes to the core streaming and analysis logic
5. WHEN implementing the solution THEN the system SHALL document the architecture for future CCTV integration
