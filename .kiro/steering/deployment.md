# Deployment Guidelines

## Environment Configuration

### Development Environment
```bash
# Required software
- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 18+
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Git

# Setup commands
git clone <repository>
cd hifazat-ai
docker-compose up --build
```

### Production Environment
```bash
# Resource requirements
- CPU: 4+ cores (optimized for i5 6th gen)
- RAM: 6GB minimum, 8GB recommended
- Storage: 20GB for system + data storage
- Network: Stable internet for threat feed updates

# Environment variables
export ENVIRONMENT=production
export LOG_LEVEL=INFO
export DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///data/alerts.db
export CORS_ORIGINS=https://your-domain.com
```

## Container Deployment

### Docker Configuration
- Use multi-stage builds for smaller images
- Set resource limits appropriate for target hardware
- Configure health checks for container orchestration
- Use non-root user for security
- Mount persistent volumes for data storage

### Cloud Deployment Options

#### Google Cloud Platform
- **Cloud Run**: Serverless container deployment
- **Compute Engine**: VM-based deployment with custom configuration
- **Cloud Storage**: Model and data storage
- **Cloud Functions**: Serverless processing for specific tasks

#### AWS
- **ECS Fargate**: Managed container service
- **EC2**: Virtual machine deployment
- **S3**: Object storage for models and data
- **Lambda**: Serverless functions

#### Azure
- **Container Instances**: Simple container deployment
- **App Service**: Platform-as-a-service deployment
- **Blob Storage**: Object storage solution

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Health Checks
- API endpoint health monitoring
- Database connection status
- AI model loading and inference status
- Memory and CPU usage tracking
- Alert processing pipeline status

### Logging Strategy
- Centralized logging with structured format
- Log rotation to prevent disk space issues
- Different log levels for different environments
- Error alerting and notification setup

### Backup and Recovery
- Regular database backups
- Model checkpoint storage
- Configuration backup
- Disaster recovery procedures

## Security Deployment
- Use HTTPS in production
- Implement proper firewall rules
- Regular security updates
- Secrets management (avoid hardcoded credentials)
- Network isolation for sensitive components
