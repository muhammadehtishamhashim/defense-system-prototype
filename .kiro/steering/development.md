# Development Guidelines

## Code Standards

### Python Backend
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints for all function parameters and returns
- Maximum line length: 88 characters (Black formatter)
- Use docstrings for all classes and functions
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Use Pydantic models for data validation

### TypeScript Frontend
- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Prefer functional components with hooks
- Use proper TypeScript interfaces for all props
- Follow React best practices (avoid prop drilling, use context appropriately)
- Use semantic HTML and accessibility attributes
- Implement proper error boundaries

## Testing Strategy

### Backend Testing
- Unit tests for all business logic functions
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Mock external dependencies (AI models, databases)
- Test coverage target: >80%
- Use pytest fixtures for test data setup

### Frontend Testing
- Component unit tests with React Testing Library
- Integration tests for user workflows
- Mock API calls in tests
- Test accessibility compliance
- Visual regression testing for critical components

## Git Workflow
- Use feature branches for all development
- Commit messages should be descriptive and follow conventional commits
- Squash commits before merging to main
- Require code review for all pull requests
- Run tests and linting before committing

## Performance Optimization
- Profile code regularly to identify bottlenecks
- Use lazy loading for heavy components
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Monitor memory usage and optimize garbage collection
- Use ONNX models for faster CPU inference

## Error Handling
- Implement comprehensive error logging
- Use structured logging with appropriate log levels
- Provide meaningful error messages to users
- Implement retry logic for transient failures
- Monitor error rates and set up alerting

## Security Best Practices
- Validate all user inputs
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Store sensitive data securely (environment variables)
- Regular security audits and dependency updates
